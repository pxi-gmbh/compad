# pxi.compad

a signal pad that syncs over webRTC for a few needed asides (signals, countdown timer) in meetings.

a quick introduction can be found in the web app. sorry for the slow updates, we can make do with the current version, hence the lack of urgency.

v0.2 is under development and a complete rewrite. will also address more use cases. we will make it public, once we finish refactoring.

thanks
